Redis on MagLev

## Why?

Because it's \_why day, \_why day, gotta hack it's \_why day!

## What's implemented so far?

* set
* get
* exists
* del
* keys (with glob pattern)

## Inspiration

\_why of course! [Redis](http://redis.io) also. [ctoneal's strc](https://github.com/ctoneal/strc) is cool too but I want a real Redis within MagLev.
